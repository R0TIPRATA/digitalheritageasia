      <p class="text-center" id="home-intro-text" style="line-height:2;">Digital Cultural Heritage Asia is an <span class="span-colored"> online platform for the dissemination of endangered cultural heritage resources from the Asian region </span>, particularly those focused on urban contexts.
        It provides digital copies of "cultural heritage blind spots", locations that are typically at <span class="span-colored"> risk of disappearance</span>, non-gazetted, non-protected, contested, less popular, or challenging to handle. The platform is spearheaded by Dr David Ocon, an Assistant Professor at Singapore Management University's School of Social Sciences.</p>

  <p class="text-center">Digital Cultural Heritage Asia focuses on the use of low-cost digital tools such as digital documentation and archiving, virtual mapping with 360-degree capturing technology, interactive maps, podcasts, and consumer-grade UAV (drone) photography and filming. The platform offers alternative encounters with less-known urban Asian cultural heritage sites, acting as their 'memory insurance policy' in case of destruction or disappearance.</p>

      <p class="text-center project-descr">Digital Cultural Heritage Asia encourages reflection on the importance of cultural heritage in Asian cities, often threatened by the very process of urban growth and development. It also demonstrates that the design of parallel digital worlds can provide respectful and sustainable ways of preserving the priceless memories associated with cultural heritage, opening new ways of interacting with it.
      Digital Cultural Heritage Asia started in 2022 with the creation of a first digital copy of the Muslim cemetery Kubor Kassim in Singapore, thanks to the support of a Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund (AcRF) Tier 1 grant.</p>
